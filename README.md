# dotfiles

Reasonable dotfiles for a quick setup

## Install

To quickly configure the scripts run

```bash
zsh configure.zsh
```

Here, you will be asked if you want to use `tmux`. If so, tmux will be installed and set as entrypoint when you start zsh. Otherwise the `tmux`'s installation will be skipped.
